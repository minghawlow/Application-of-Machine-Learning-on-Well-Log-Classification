# Application-of-Machine-Learning-on-Well-Log-Classification

This project is one part of the activities in Energy Mentor Program 2021 by SPE KL. Our team is working on the machine learning algorithm on well log analysis in finding hycarbon. The purpose of this project is to compare the performance of different model for cluster classification. It showed that stacked approach method with a combination of logistic regression and gradient boosting have a better result.

In this repository, it includes the raw well data file, the interpreted well data file (Aud-3), and the python file. The Aud3 well data are interpreted by other group using Techlog and compared with the result obtained using unsupervised machine learning method (Not shown in this repository). The interpreted well data is used to determine the performandce of different machine learning model in determining the lithology of the subsurface.
